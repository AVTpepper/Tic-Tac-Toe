# __Portfolio Porject 2 - Tic Tac Toe__

The Tic Tac Toe website is for anyone looking for an online game that has elements of competition and strategy. This website is created for somebody who is looking for some quick fun with a friend, or by themselves.

## __Wireframes__
Before starting the project I created my ideal look of the Tic Tac Toe website to have an idea of what I pictured myself creating. This was the beginning of the project and I had high hopes of what I was going to be able to accomplish.

## __Features__
This website has a low count of features, but in the future it will be fun to come back and add the features that I have in mind.

### __Existing Features__

- __Heading__
    - Simple and minimalistic header to open the page. It is clear what the intention of the website is.

- __Scoreboard__
    - Next we have the scoreboard. This is where the points will be tracked for each round won by each player.

- __Game Controls__
    - Here we have our game controls. With these buttons you can control the scoreboard and the playing board. The action of the button is written on the button itself. The top button will reset the score and the bottom bottom will start a new round and clear the board.

- __Playing Board__
    - This is where the action takes place. Each square is clickable, and each click will alternate between "X" and "O".

### __Technologies Used__
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### __Features Left To Implement__
I have several features I would like to implement:
- More website visitor controls over the game. Such as:
    - Chosing what marker they want to be, "X" or "O".
    - Chosing to play against the computer or another player.
- Creating the computer controlled player.
- Adding more style to the page.
- Adding hover effects.
- Adding a help menu.

## __Testing__

Running my JavaScript code through jshint.com I realised I was missing quite a few semicolons and had some unecessary ones, so I spent some time to get that corrected. I also got warnings such as: 
- 	'let' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz)  & 'const' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz) which I am not sure how to fix.

### __Lighthouse Test__
